Hey this is Chaiyeen Oh's story. You are in the right file! And here's my story. 


Once upon a time there was University of Wisconsin-Madison student named Bob. Bob is extremely intelligent that he even got a merit scholarship. But Bob was so poor that he had to work while he was attending school. Then one day,,,  


A dragon came into his dream, and says,"Bob, lovely Bob. How is going on? I would love to have a wish once an year as I usually do. What do you want?" And Bob says, "Oh really? and why didn't you come last year? I can't remember that you came into my dream." Dragon replies,"I was in my business. I couldn't come. Instead, I honor you two wishies. What is your dream?" ..

Bob thought for a long time. He could ask for anything and everything he ever wanted... all the riches and comforts in the world, he would never have to work again... But Bob, being a kind and hard-working man who truly believes in himself and wants to make a positive impact in the world. After much thought, he decided to ask the dragon for another season of Game of Thrones.

Bob made a wise decision. Because by watching that, he got fresh and could study much better and better. The result was more brilliant in studying, and in years he could be a computer science instructor!

After he became a Computer Science instructor, he did lots of researches and found amazing theory and became rich. Although Bob was incredibly rich, smart and famous he felt void. So, with the last wish, he wished for a beautiful and kind wife to get marry with. Then the wish came true and Bob married beautiful Annie and they lived happily ever after!
