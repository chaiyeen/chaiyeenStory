Hey this is Chaiyeen Oh's story. You are in the right file! And here's my story. 


Once upon a time there was University of Wisconsin-Madison student named Bob. Bob is extremely intelligent that he even got a merit scholarship. But Bob was so poor that he had to work while he was attending school. Then one day,,,  


A dragon came into his dream, and says,"Bob, lovely Bob. How is going on? I would love to have a wish once an year as I usually do. What do you want?" And Bob says, "Oh really? and why didn't you come last year? I can't remember that you came into my dream." Dragon replies,"I was in my business. I couldn't come. Instead, I honor you two wishies. What is your dream?" ..

Bob thought for a long time. He could ask for anything and everything he ever wanted... all the riches and comforts in the world, he would never have to work again... But Bob, being a kind and hard-working man who truly believes in himself and wants to make a positive impact in the world. After much thought, he decided to ask the dragon for another season of Game of Thrones.

Bob made a wise decision. Because by watching that, he got fresh and could study much better and better. The result was more brilliant in studying, and in years he could be a computer science instructor!
