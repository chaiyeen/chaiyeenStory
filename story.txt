Hey this is Chaiyeen Oh's story. You are in the right file! And here's my joke: I'm so good at sleeping. I can do it with my eyes closed. hahaha do you like it? Okay, so here's another one: My boss told me to have a good day... so I went home

I went home, but there was my mom. 
She just finished her baking, and asked me to try her cookies.
I was so sleepy, but I tried the cookie.

I want to introduce CrazyJavaProgrammer to you my friends. She is a smart java programmer, but she uses her intelligence to code for games or funny stuffs. I hope she uses her skills in a better way!
